# FHIR Forms Tester

## This lightweight experimental tool lets you share fully-rendered FHIR Questionnaires with respondents—like Google Forms—and see a summary view of responses in two simple steps [1-2].

### Built using the LForms library at the 2023 Sept Phoenix Connectathon as part of the Questionnaire track.

- [1] GET Questionnaire (where does your Questionnaire live?)

- [2] POST QuestionnaireResponse (where should responses be sent?)
